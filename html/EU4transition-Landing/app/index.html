              <p><strong>ENTRECOMP4TRANSITION</strong> together with <strong>NINJABLE</strong> are presenting you with the tool that will allow you to
                reflect on your experience and confidence to identify your strengths and areas you would like to
                improve.
              </p>
              <p>You will have had plenty of experiences across different areas of your life - leisure, family,
                community,
                education or work. As a result of these different experiences, how experienced and confident do you feel
                in your ability to think or act entrepreneurially?
              </p>
              <p>We have prepared a set of 15 scenarios and after completing them all you will be guided through your
                identified competence areas and skills. Answer each question by selecting the option which best
                describes
                your approach.
              </p>
              <p>
                Completing the tool can be a standalone activity or used to motivate yourself before and after
                undertaking
                any training. You could also use it as your personal tracking diary to understand what skills you need
                to
                develop and how.
